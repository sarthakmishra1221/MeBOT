# MeBOT

Problem-
Approximately *16 lacs* of people die every year in India due to improper medication and roughly 54% of the people forget to take the medicine at the correct time because of their busy schedule. Also, many old people are not capable to take the correct medicine at right time and sometimes they need a caretaker. All these factors may lead to health problems.

Solution-
The system will respond by a sound alert system and a message notification to the user at the scheduled time. Then the user needs to respond by pressing a button to get the medicines. There will be a provision to dispense the syrup if scheduled and a glass of water if needed. In case the user forgets to take the medicine, the system will alert with a sound alarm after every 10 minutes. After 30 minutes a notification will be sent to the caretaker.
The soltion can be MeBOT, on which I am curently working.
